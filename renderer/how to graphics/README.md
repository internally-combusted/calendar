# How To Graphics

This is the extremely long and extremely goofy tutorial/FAQ I've written for gfx_hal/Rust/Vulkan to help me piece together the stuff I've learned, which is a lot and also not much at the same time.

It is extremely long and also extremely goofy. 

If it's useful/funny/interesting, great! If not, please don't hold it against me.
