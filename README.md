# I'm Ryan McGowan

...and this is my code portfolio! I'm currently looking to start a career as a software developer in the Kansas City area, so I've put up some samples of my personal work to showcase what I can do.

I have a BS in computer science from the [New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology](https://www.nmt.edu) and an MA in linguistics from [the University of New Mexico](https://www.unm.edu). My academic work was primarily with C/C++ and Java, but my recent personal work has mostly been in Rust, Javascript, Python, and Racket. 

I enjoy learning and I've done quite a bit of self-teaching, but I'm hoping to get some practical experience and to learn from more experienced developers. I'm especially interested in doing work related to healthcare or education.

Take a look around or visit [my website](https://internally-combusted.net), or maybe even drop me a line at [ryan@internally-combusted.net](mailto:ryan@internally-combusted.net). 

Thanks for visiting, and enjoy your day!

 — Ryan
